A Console application to track company assets (computers and phones). The app stores simple asset records, calculates end-of-life (EoL) and prints a formatted asset list with local and converted prices. 

### [https://github.com/jiantaoshen/SmartAssetTrackingSystem#](https://github.com/jiantaoshen/SmartAssetTrackingSystem#)

## Features
- Add assets via interactive console input
- User input local price based on the office location (USD for US, SEK for Sweden, EUR for Germany) and it will be converted to USD (exchange rate based on current exchange rates) 
- Show 20 assets (Pagingation, could be changed in AssetService.cs) with EoL status (indicated by color coding, yellow for 6 months remaining, red for 3 months remaining and expired)
- Menu navigation with options to add/remove/update/search assets, view assets, and quit the application
- Database `Assets` with discriminator `ComputerAsset` and `MobileAsset`
- Sample assets are inserted at startup for quick inspection

## Tech stack
- C# 14
- .NET 10
- Entity Framework Core 10
- SQL Local Server

## Project structure 
- `Program.cs` — Entry point
- All functions in Program.cs are from `AssetService.cs` in the Services folder, which contains all the business logic for asset management and user interaction.
- `Data/MyDbContext.cs` — Database context for Entity Framework Core
- `Data/testData.cs` — Test data initialization
- `Models` — Asset models: `Asset`, `ComputerAsset`, `MobileAsset` and Office model: `Office`
- `Repositories` — Repository and interface for Reports, Assets and Offices. 
- `Helpers` — Utility functions and extensions.
- `Services/External` — External services

## Future work
- Because console.clear() only clears the current visible console buffer in Visual Studio, the console output will be cluttered after multiple interactions.
I'm going to implement a paging system to show only a limited number of assets at a time, and allow users to navigate through pages of assets. 
This will improve the user experience and make it easier to manage larger lists of assets without overwhelming the console output.
